# Basic-Priority-Inheritance-Protocol

This simulation was done as a part of my semester project in real-time systems. It demonstrates the scheduling performed by the Basic Priority Inheritance Protocol.

The examples tested on are from the reference book in Real Time Systems by Liu. The code was written from scratch in C, and works for any given number of jobs and resources.

Simply run the driver.c file from console with an input format as specified in the input file.
